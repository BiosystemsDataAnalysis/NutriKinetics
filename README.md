# NutriKinetics
shiny app computer exercise with some practical aspects of nutrikinetics  

Important aspects for the application of nutrikinetics are the influence of measurement error, the influence of the design of the study, the ability to retrieve parameter values both at the population level (average across groups) as well as at the individual level (individual varia- tion).  

Some of these aspects will return in the exercises app, **Nutrikinetics**, to generate (simulate) data and then fit the generated data to a predefined model. The estimated model parameters can be compared with the ones used to generate the data
